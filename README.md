# Evaluate-the-performance-_of-Big-SQL-_and-No-SQL-_database-for-the-same-dataset.
# Overview
This project compares the performance of Big SQL and NoSQL databases using the same dataset. The analysis includes query execution time, scalability, and efficiency under different workloads.

# Dataset
The dataset used for evaluation is uploaded in this repository. It contains structured and semi-structured data suitable for both SQL and NoSQL databases.

# Technologies Used
1) SQL Database: Big SQL (e.g., IBM Big SQL, PostgreSQL)

2) NoSQL Database: MongoDB, Cassandra

3) Tools: Python, Google Colab

# Performance Metrics
1) Query execution time

2) Data retrieval efficiency

3) Scalability under load

4) Indexing and partitioning impact
